<h1>Geniuz-Manager</h1>
A subscription manager for discord. 
<h2>Why Use this?</h2>
<p>This bot allows you to keep everything automated. Suppose you have a server and users pay for access to a channel such as a Dropshipping server for a brief time. This bot makes things so much easier. All you need to do is put the generated codes into https://shoppy.gg or any other site through which the user can buy. The website would return and give one of the codes the bot generated. Once the code is retrieved, you don't have to go through the hassle of manually redeeming it for the user. Once the user uses the command to redeem the code, the timer starts right then and there. They would get access to the discord channel via role access. Once their subscription is over, the role will be wiped in a 3-minute interval.</p>
Very Simple and Easy to use. 
<h2>Perks</h2>
One instance of the bot can run manage multiple servers because the bot creates each servers its own little data holder.
